# Spokane Code in the Dark

*"Code in the Dark"* is a nighttime frontend code competition with a party like atmosphere, including a DJ.

## Contestants

You'll have a simple "editor" *no plugins or intellisense*,  and a screen shot that you can refer to as many times as you like.

The winner of each heat is decided by the audience. The competition continues until there's only one contestant left â€” the Champion of Code
